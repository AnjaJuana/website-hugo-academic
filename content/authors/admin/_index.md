Anja Juana Rueten-Budde obtained a BSc degree in Mathematics at the University of Bremen, Germany in 2013. In 2013 she continued her studies at Leiden University where she completed the Master programme ‘Statistical Science for the Life & Behavioural Sciences’ in 2015.

During her Master studies she completed an internship collaborating with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery of the Leiden University Medical Center under the supervision of dr. Marta Fiocco, which made the start of her research of soft tissue sarcoma. The results of this intership assisted in obtaining a grant from the KWF to fund part of her PhD research which she started in 2016 under the supervision of dr. Marta Fiocco at Leiden University. Her work focused on developing accurate prediction models for patients with high-grade extremity soft tissue sarcoma. Results of this research are presented in this thesis and were implemented in the PERSARC mobile application for use in clinical practice. The impact of the PERSARC application is currently studied by researchers at the Leiden University Medical Center. Their research is funded by a grant from the KWF.

She has been teaching assistant in various courses and was lecturer of Statistics at Leiden University College (The Hague). In the last year of her PhD research she was lecturer for the Survival Analysis course from the Statistical Science master programme. She has been involved in a number of consultations at the Leiden University Medical Center in which she helped clinicians with their data analysis. During her PhD research time she presented her research at conferences in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Finnland, Canada, and Denmark. She was co-organizer of the con- ference Survival Analysis for Junior Researchers 2018 in Leiden which was the first time that the conference took place outside of the United Kingdom.

F﻿rom 2020-2022 she worked as a postdoc at Erasmus Medical Center. The postdoc position was part of the convergence of health and technology project between Erasmus University, Erasmus Medical Center and Delft University of Technology. Within this project the aim was to apply and develop machine learning algorithms to improve patient care, with particular interest in patients suffering from hypertension. 

In her free time she enjoys to knit and was part of the Mathematical Institute Knitting Club. In 2019 she published her first knitting pattern under the name ’Spherical fractal scarf’ which was a collaboration with Niels Langeveld.
